*   **☁️ Instant Cloud Upload & Short Links:** Every screenshot or screen recording is automatically uploaded to your secure cloud storage, and a short link (like `cln.sh/...`) is copied to your clipboard for instant sharing.
*   **✏️ Annotate Before You Share:** Use the built-in editor to add arrows, highlights, text, blurs, and numbers to your images right after capture, before they're uploaded.
*   **📚 Visual History & Management:** Access your entire capture history in a beautiful, searchable dashboard. Organize files, view stats, and manage your cloud storage.

## About CleanShot Cloud
CleanShot Cloud is the integrated cloud-sharing component of the popular CleanShot X application, designed to transform the simple act of taking a screenshot into a seamless sharing workflow. It addresses the common friction points of saving a file locally, opening a sharing service, uploading, and then copying a link. With CleanShot Cloud, this process is reduced to a single keystroke: capture, annotate if needed, and the link is already on your clipboard. The upload happens in the background, providing a direct link to a beautifully presented page where viewers can see your image or play your recording without downloading anything.

The platform is built for clarity and collaboration. Shared links open to a clean, branded page without distracting ads or unnecessary UI. For screen recordings, it provides a dedicated video player. The dashboard gives you full control over your content, allowing you to delete shares, see view counts, and organize captures into folders. This makes it invaluable for professionals like developers reporting bugs, designers sharing mockups, customer support teams explaining steps, or remote teams communicating visually. By combining a best-in-class capture tool with effortless, reliable sharing, CleanShot Cloud turns visual communication into a superpower.
